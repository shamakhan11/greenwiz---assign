GREENWIZ ASSIGNMENT 
Student name : Shama khan

Lets get started.

Here I made an image hunter kind of bot which is mentioned in the assignment which will basically capture all the images from the website which is mentioned.

We will do it in by the help of node.js
First of all we need two dependencies. First one is cheerio so we made a simple object to import this then we use request because we need that now we define fs object.
After that we have to create a write stream then we just define the write stream with the image link and all. That is our file object actually.

Now let us define a request object and we’ll make a request. The request would be  based on a url now what we have to do is write a simple if statement to further run our code .

Lets move forward very first thing i define my cheerio object just like js simple query syntax $ 
And we load the html that we have defined there in the function once we have the html content .
Since we have to grab all images from the website . 

When we have the all stuff together in the form of code we’ll search for images syntax that we have and then we grab the attributes . then we gonna define our baseurl 

Now we gonna combine all of them 
When you run node script.js you will see there will lots of links given there you can choose and download the image

Thank you. 

You can simply run npm start into your terminal 
then your code will run and you'll find some links ,
so you can simply copy those link and paste those to your browser
and you'll find that the img in a correct format will be saved
